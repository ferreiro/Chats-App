Chats-App
=========

This is a version of the well known app "Whatsapp" made on my university. Basically, the idea is create an "non-real time chat" where you can send messages to your friends, see your inbox or delete chats.  Also there is a version using dinamic arrays.

Note: You can login using this usernames: casillas, dcosta, cristiano, pepe and simeone. Please note that in ordr to add new users and all this stuff you need to create files following the structure of the current files.
